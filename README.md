# :neutral_face: Nihilipsum

Built a lorem ipsum generator that spits out Stranger Things quotes. It's built with Node and Express. You're able to select the number of paragraphs you'd like to generate and there is also a button that allows you to easily copy all the generated text.

## :running: Running the App Locally

Begin by running app.js in your terminal with the command `node app.js` and then access the application in your browser at *localhost:3000*.

## :skull: Heroku App Deployment

In order to update the live application on Heroku, the command `git push heroku master` must be executed inside of the project folder.
